--Feature Selector--
FeatureGrabber
--classifier---
KNN

For Feature Grabber,
1. you will need to configure the external config
    - imageDirectory field with the location of the segmented images.
2. you will also need to configure the outputDirectory field in the external config to denote where you want the csv_report
directory to be generated.
