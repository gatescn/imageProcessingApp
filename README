To run program

1st: configure your processed image outputs/input folder as well filters you would like to use for this batch. The program
will apply the filters in sequential order.
Filters to choose from:

GaussianNoiseFilter
LinearFilter
MedianFilter
SaltAndPepperFilter

2nd: define your filter definitions using the operationDefinition files in the operationDefinitionRepository folder.
These are used to change the default values used by the filters.
Currently implemented filters:
Gaussian Noise
inputs:
strength: int = 1 or 2. 2 is the max

Salt and Pepper Noise
inputs:
strength: int = 1 or 2, 2 is the max

Linear Filter
inputs:
Mask Size = int = 1 or 2, 2 is the max
Filter Weight = decimal

Median Filter
inputs:
Mask Size = = 1 or 2, 2 is the max
Filter Weight = decimal

Directories are produced for each filter along with the Histogram folder which will contain the histogram outputs for each
image processed.
History folders are produced after every run so you don't lose previously filtered images.

Missing implementations:
Histogram Equalization
Color Conversion
Histogram Quantization
